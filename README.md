# Inspection Report Generator

A program to allow the inspector to create his own custom pdf report cover and receipt, then combine that with the inspection report pdf generated by his inspection software.

## Notes:

- First time using npm packages "React PDF Renderer", "React Image File Resizer", and "PDF Merger JS".
- Was thrilled with how simple the image file resizer was to work with - need to impliment it in other projects, especially the Nosh family recipe app.
- Was very disappointed that accessing blob data imperatively does not work in React PDF v2, because that would have allowed me to make this a one step process for the inspector to create his final report instead a two step process. Tried downgrading to v1.6.9 to access the blob data, but it broke the pdf creation.

- **_ Ended up removing the PDF merge functionality - the resulting pdf file size became enormous. Will have the inspector combine the pdf's in adobe pro dc instead. _**

## To Do:

- Need to check back in with React PDF Renderer in the future to see if they fixed the blob data bug.
